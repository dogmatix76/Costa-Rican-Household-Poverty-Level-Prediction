Are you up for the challenge?\n\n> Here's the backstory: Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.\n\n> In Latin America, one popular method uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. It’s called the Proxy Means Test (or PMT). With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need.\n\n> While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.\nBeyond Costa Rica, many countries face this same problem of inaccurately assessing social need.\n\n"

The training set has 9557 rows and 143 columns while the testing set has 23856 rows and 142 columns. Each row represents one individual and each column is a feature, either unique to the individual, or for the household of the individual. The training set has one additional column, Target, which represents the poverty level on a 1-4 scale and is the label for the competition. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty.\n\nThis is a supervised multi-class classification machine learning problem:\n- Supervised: provided with the labels for the training data\n- Multi-class classification: Labels are discrete values with 4 classes"

We are given data on the individual level with each individual having unique features but also information about their household. In order to create a dataset for the task, we'll have to perform some aggregations of the individual data for each household. Moreover, we have to make a prediction for every individual in the test set, but \"ONLY the heads of household are used in scoring\" which means we want to predict poverty on a household basis."

This variable is not a feature, but will be used to group individuals by - household as all individuals in a household will have the same identifier.\n- **parentesco1** : indicates if this person is the head of the household.\n- **Target** : the label, which should be equal for all members in a household\n\nWhen we make a model, we'll train on a household basis with the label for each household the poverty level of the head of household. The raw data contains a mix of both household and individual characteristics and for the individual data, we will have to find a way to aggregate this for each household. Some of the individuals belong to a household with no head of household which means that unfortunately we can't use this data for training. These issues with the data are completely typical of real-world data and hence this problem is great preparation for the datasets you'll encounter in a data science job!\n\n"

Think about this in human terms: if we are classifiying poverty and we see far more cases of no poverty than extreme poverty, it will make it more difficult for us to identify the high poverty households because of less exposure. One potential method to address class imbalanceds is through oversampling (which is covered in more advanced notebooks)."

Typically, 80% of a data science project will be spent cleaning data and fixing anomalies/errors. These can be either human entry errors, measurement errors, or sometimes just extreme values that are correct but stand out. For this problem, some of the labels are not correct because individuals in the same household have a different poverty level. We're not told why this may be the case, but we are told to use the head of household as the true label.\n\nThat information makes our job much easier, but in a real-world problem, we would have to figure out the reason Why the labels are wrong and how to address the issue on our own. This section fixes the issue with the labels although it is not strictly necessary: I kept it in the notebook just to show how we may deal with this issue.\n\nIdentify Errors\nFirst we need to find the errors before we can correct them. To find the households with different labels for family members, we can group the data by the household and then check if there is only one unique value of the Target."

This is that part of the analysis: we have to define the columns that are at an individual level and at a household level using the data decsriptions. There is simply no other way to identify which variables at are the household level than to go through the variables themselves in the data description. Except, I've already done this for you, so all you have to do is copy and paste!\n\nWe'll define different variables because we need to treat some of them in a different manner. Once we have the variables defined on each level, we can work to start aggregating them as needed.\n\nThe process is as follows\n\n1. Break variables into household level and invididual level\n2. Find suitable aggregations for the individual level data\n    - Ordinal variables can use statistical aggregations\n    - Boolean variables can also be aggregated but with fewer stats\n3. Join the individual aggregations to the household level data\n\n### Define Variable Categories\nThere are several different categories of variables:\n\n1. Individual Variables: these are characteristics of each individual rather than the household\n    - Boolean: Yes or No (0 or 1)\n    - Ordered Discrete: Integers with an ordering\n2. Household variables\n    - Boolean: Yes or No\n    - Ordered Discrete: Integers with an ordering\n    - Continuous numeric\n3. Squared Variables: derived from squaring variables in the data\n4. Id variables: identifies the data and should not be used as features\n\nBelow we manually define the variables in each category. This is a little tedious, but also necessary."

Therefore, as the warning increases, the poverty level also increases which makes sense because this was meant to show potential bad signs about a house. The hogar_nin is the number of children 0 - 19 in the family which also makes sense: younger children can be financial source of stress on a family leading to higher levels of poverty. Or, families with lower socioeconomic status have more children in the hopes that one of them will be able to succeed. Whatever the explanation, there is a real link between family size and poverty\n\nOn the other hand, for the positive correlations, a higher value means a higher value of Target indicating the poverty severity decreases. The most highly correlated household level variable is meaneduc, the average education level of the adults in the household. This relationship between education and poverty intuitively makes sense: greater levels of education generally correlate with lower levels of poverty. We don't necessarily know which causes which, but we do know these tend to move in the same direction.\n\nThe general guidelines for correlation values are below, but these will change depending on who you ask ([source](http://www.statstutor.ac.uk/resources/uploaded/pearsons.pdf) for these):\n\n- .00-.19 “very weak”\n- .20-.39 “weak”\n- .40-.59 “moderate”\n- .60-.79 “strong”\n- .80-1.0 “very strong”\n\nWhat these correlations show is that there are some weak relationships that hopefully our model will be able to use to learn a mapping from the features to the Target.\n\nNow we can move on to the Spearman correlation."

This probably won't get us to the top of the leaderboard, but it will allow us to establish a baseline. Later we'll try several other models including the powerful Gradient Boosting Machine.\n\nTo assess our model, we'll use 10-fold cross validation on the training data. This will essentially train and test the model 10 times using different splits of the training data. 10-fold cross validation is an effective method for estimating the performance of a model on the test set. We want to look at the average performance in cross validation as well as the standard deviation to see how much scores change between the folds. We use the F1 Macro measure to evaluate performance."

We already tried one basic model, the Random Forest Classifier which delivered a best macro F1 of 0.35. However, in machine learning, there is no way to know ahead of time which model will work best for a given dataset. The following plot shows that **there are some problems where even Gaussian Naive Bayes will outperform a gradient boosting machine.** This is from an excellent paper by [Randal Olson that discusses many points of machine learning](https://psb.stanford.edu/psb-online/proceedings/psb18/olson.pdf)\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WillKoehrsen/Machine-Learning-Projects/master/algorithm_comparison.png\">\n\nWhat this plot tells us is that we have to try out a number of different models to see which is optimal. Most people eventually settle on the **gradient boosting machine** and we will try that out, but for now we'll take a look at some of the other options. There are literally dozens (maybe hundreds) of multi-class machine learning models if we look at the [Scikit-Learn documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html). We don't have to try them all, but we should sample from the options.\n\nWhat we want to do is write a function that can evaluate a model. This will be pretty simple since we already wrote most of the code. In addition to the Random Forest Classifier, we'll try eight other Scikit-Learn models. Luckily, this dataset is relatively small and we can rapidly iterate through the models. We will make a dataframe to hold the results and the function will add a row to the dataframe for each model."

We'll use the GBM in LightGBM, although there are also options in Scikit-Learn, XGBOOST, and CatBoost. The first set of hyperparameters we'll use were based on those I've found have worked well for other problems.\n\n### Choosing Number of Estimators with Early Stopping\nTo choose the number of estimators (the number of decision trees in the ensemble, called n_estimators or num_boost_rounds), we'll use early stopping with 5-fold cross validation.

In this notebook, we'll use a set of hyperparameters that I've found work well on previous problems (although they will not necessarily translate to this competition).\n\nWe set the n_estimators to 10000 but we won't actually reach this number because we are using early stopping which will quit training estimators when the cross validation metric does not improve for early_stopping_rounds.

[ICA: Independent Components Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_component_analysis). Attempts to separate a mutltivariate signal into independent signals.\n3. [TSNE: T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume9/vandermaaten08a/vandermaaten08a.pdf). Maps high-dimensional data to a low-dimensional manifold attempting to maintain the local structure within the data. It is a non-linear technique and generally only used for visualization.\n4. [UMAP: Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf): A relatively new technique that also maps data to a low-dimensional manifold but tries to preserve more global structure than TSNE.\n\n\nAll four of these methods are relatively simple to implement in Python. We'll map the selected features down to 3 dimensions for visualization and then also use PCA, ICA, and UMAP as features for modeling (TSNE has no transform method and hence cannot be used for preprocessing)."

Machine learning is really just a series of steps, each simple by themselves, with the overall result often extremely powerful.\n\nOur path was as follows:\n\n1. Understand the problem\n2. Exploratory Data Analysis\n    - Deal with data issues\n    - Fill in missing values\n3. Feature Engineering\n    - Aggregate data\n    - Feature selection in stages\n4. Model Selection\n    - Try many different models to see which one is most promising\n    - Feature selection can also come into play\n5. Model Optimization\n    - Choose the best performing model and tune\n6. Implementing best model\n7. Investigate predictions\n    - Identify model shortcomings\n8. Try new techniques\n    - Experiment and learn!\n\nAs stated in the introduction, while these steps do have a general order, there is nothing preventing us from repeating them based on subsequent work. For example, we often go back to feature engineering/selection after modeling if we are not satisfied with our performance. After investigating predictions, we might return to the modeling stage and re-think our approach.\n\nIt's also important to keep in mind that machine learning is largely empirical: there are few established best practices so you need to constantly experiement to determine what works best. That's why we included the last step: we got to try out some new methods and even if they don't pay off for this project, they may be useful in the future. As data scientists we need to be constantly learning to do our work more effectively with the best tools possible.\n\nOur final model does well compared to others in the competition, but overall is not extremely accurate. There might be ways to improve performance, but overall, we might not have enough data to achieve exceptional metrics. That's an important point to remember: at the end of the day, the success or failure of a data science project will rest on the quality and quantity of available data. We have solved the problem of classifying household poverty in Porto Rica as well as we can with the available tools, and the next process if we were in charge would be figuring out what more data could be collected to yield a better solution.\n\n## Next Steps\nAlthough we tried many possible approaches, there are still some methods that we did not implement but might prove useful:\n\nFurther Hyperparameter tuning: we did not spend much time optimizing the model and there are other packages for optimization that we could try.\n\nFurther feature selection: we probably do not need to retain all of the features to get the same performance\n[Oversampling the minority class](http://contrib.scikit-learn.org/imbalanced-learn/stable/over_sampling.html) / undersampling the majority class: an advanced techinque that might improve performance\nEnsembling or stacking multiple models. We could train models on different sections of the data and then combine their predictions to try and better separate the classes. It might also be worthwhile to include models other than the gradient boosting machine.\n\nThe most valuable part of a Kaggle competition is never the rewards, but the knowledge gained along the way. These contests are great for learning how to solve realistic problems and I approach every new problem as an opportunity to improve as a data scientist. Thanks for reading!\n\nIf you're looking for more on this competition, I have a kernel using automated feature engineering for this problem: [Featuretools](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/featuretools-for-good) for Good."
